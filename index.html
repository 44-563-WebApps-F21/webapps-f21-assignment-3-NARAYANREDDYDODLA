    <h1>Narayan Reddy Dodla</h1>
    <h6>Vikarabad</h6>
    <p>Vikarabad is a <b>town</b> and mandal in <b>Vikarabad</b> district of the Indian state of <b>Telangana</b>. It is located in Vikarabad mandal of Vikarabad revenue division.
       A forest region which is home to the <b>Anantha Padmanabha Swamy temple</b>. and the source of the <b>Musi River</b>. Telangana's second largest <b>tuberculosis hospital</b> is located in the Ananthagiri hills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like this Town because <b>Ananthagiri hills</b> are the best during peak rainy season as its fresh and green all around. They host a temple of <b>Lord Padhmanabhaswamy</b> which is a must visit when one plans for the hills.
