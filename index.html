    <h1>Narayan Reddy Dodla</h1>
    <h6>Vikarabad</h6>
    <p>Vikarabad is a <b>town</b> and mandal in <b>Vikarabad</b> district of the Indian state of <b>Telangana</b>. It is located in Vikarabad mandal of Vikarabad revenue division.
       A forest region which is home to the <b>Anantha Padmanabha Swamy temple</b>. and the source of the <b>Musi River</b>. Telangana's second largest <b>tuberculosis hospital</b> is located in the Ananthagiri hills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like this Town because <b>Ananthagiri hills</b> are the best during peak rainy season as its fresh and green all around. They host a temple of <b>Lord Padhmanabhaswamy</b> which is a must visit when one plans for the hills.

    <h4> Linear Diophantine Equation from Linear Algebra </h4>
        <blackquote>
            Linear algebra is about linear combinations. That is, using arithmetic on columns of numbers called vectors and arrays of numbers called matrices, to create new columns and arrays of numbers. Linear algebra is the study of lines and planes, vector spaces and mappings that are required for linear transforms.
            It is more than just the implementation of linear algebra operations in code libraries; it also includes the careful handling of the problems of applied mathematics, such as working with the limited floating point precision of digital computers.
