    <p>
      He can make it super powerful and amplify its force, along with making it immune to pain and injury. He can also use it to fire destructive blasts. Iron Fist also possesses healing abilities that allow him to recover from any injury or illness, as well as cure others.
      With eye-sight that allows him to see tiny details potentially miles away, Iron Fist’s physical powers are often augmented by his keen senses. In addition to his eyesight is his super-sensitive hearing, which can be so precise so as to allow him to hear sweat rolling down someone’s face.
